# NAS Scam

A cautionary tale of buying technolgy online through a platform you trust and of fraudulent traking numbers. And some questions for the community :)

## The Setup

I'm a technical writer moving into OSINT. I'm older and I'm recovering from a major financial setback. I've spent the last 6 months learning how to protect myself online and deciding exactly how to spend the little money I have. 

I picked out a NAS and started shopping about 3 months ago. At the time, prices were high and stock was low, so I waited. About 3 weeks ago things improved - better prices & inventory seemed to happen across a few of the platforms I was watching. 

I decided to order from Newegg - I've used them multiple times in the past and I wasn't aware of their current problems. I have since subscribed to some additional news sources :P

## The Mistake

There were a handful of Newegg sellers offering the NAS at a slightly better price than direct from Newegg. Here's where a few things came into play:

* I'm under a lot of preassure to save money.
* The world's inventory & transportation issues are compounding my time & money preassures.
* I trusted Newegg and PayPal to verify seller accounts.
* I've imagined FAKE tracking numbers and dismissed them as easy for a platform to mitigate - there are APIs for that. 
* I had no idea FRAUDULENT tracking numbers are a thing.

The net result was that I didn't think too hard when selecting a seller. Which looks especially dumb standing next to the months of research I did just deciding to buy the thing. The brutal truth is, my preasures clouded my objectivity - in different times, I'd happily part with a few extra dollars for certain assurances. 

## Non-Delivery

I placed my order and received the standard email confirmation. I waited a day and checked the traking number via Newegg which links directly to FedEx - the sending & receiving cities and estimated delivery date were as I expected. 

Ten days later and I was stoked! I swear my dog understands when I'm waiting for something - she stations herself at the front door and let's me know when mail or deliveries arrive. I spent the day responding to her every bark :) 

Around 8 pm I check FedEx and it says the package was delivered 4 hours ago. Looking at **Travel Details**, it says the package was left at my garage - there are no garages in my immeadiate area. Looking at **Shipping Facts**, the package weight & dimensions are ridiculous - 37 pounds and 83x8x6 inches. 

There's an option to obtain proof of delivery for shippers / payers or if you've gotten a waiver from one of them. The problem is, according to PayPal, Newegg is the payer - even if I had a FedEx account I'd still need a waiver, which I'm not doing. 

## Newegg's Response

Next, I head over to Newegg to start the claims process. The first step is to contact the seller. At this point I'm not the least bit suprised the seller is gone. So I use live chat to contact Newegg. 

The short version is they wanted to give the seller time to respond and possibly ship a replacement. I got stubborn but not rude. I started with how I trusted Newegg to verify its sellers and protect all transactions. Then I asked the rep to please take 5 minutes and confirm that a) the seller is gone and b) the FedEx Shipping Facts don't make sense. If these are true, I shouldn't have to wait 5 days to start a refund. 

The rep didn't respond and I thought they'd bailed. I left the window open for a while but eventually gave up for the night. The next morning I had an email notifying me a refund was in progress. 

## The Scam

It was both a relief and maddening. My brain wouldn't let it go, so I spent a few hours trying to learn how it worked. Turns out that purchasing fraudulent tracking numbers is pretty damn easy. Different from fake numbers, these are real numbers for packages that match some basic criteria. 

You can purchase the tracking number for a recently delivered package - good if you've already gotten your money and don't care when your victim finds out. Or you can purchase the number for a package currently in transit - good when it will take a few days for the money to clear. For this, you'll also want a number with the right cities and estimated delivery date.

## Questions

The last little piece that helped the scam work is that my Newegg account was showing me my full shipping address while FedEx was only showing me the correct city and zip. But that was enough for me to think Newegg and FedEx were communicating and in agreement about the address. Clearly they are not. 


## A Final Thought

I'm a seller on a popular platform. I value making room for & promoting new sellers - it took forever to get my first 100 sales & first review. I know the struggle and I realize the platform & type of purchase matters. But I've lost a measure of trust and gained a measure of anger that have me feeling like I'll never purchase from a new seller again. 

It's sad and I hope it passes - it takes some number of people willing to risk for a new business to get started and I like contributing to that. I don't want this to discourage others from purchasing from new sellers - rather the opposite. I want this to encourage you to make careful use of new sellers and to reward the good ones in every way possible - which is usually just leaving an honest review. Perceptually, a hundred sales with no reviews is about the same as having outright complaints. So if you are amoung those first brave buyers, please leave feedback :)

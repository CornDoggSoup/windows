# Opt Out

It's impossible to completely remove your data and keep it reomved from big aggregators like Whitepages.com. But you can remove the low-hanging fruit each autumn. 

* Some sites require disconnecting from VPN - usa a private browser like Brave.
* Some sites require you to make an account. 
* Some site require a phone number.
* Some sites require an email address.
* Best practice is to do the same for family members. 
* If a site refuses, you can report it to the BBB - though it ironically requires disclosure. 

Some advice says to use VoIP and masked emails for the removal process. I say it's impossible to remove your email and phone number once they're in the wild. So use them for the process - don't introduce anything new about yourself. Masked emails and that you're using one are data points. 

I say use the numbers and addresses already associated with the data. 


 I say use the phone and email already associated with the data - don't introduce anything new. I say it's easier to move forward with a new number and email than it is to remove one that's in the wild.

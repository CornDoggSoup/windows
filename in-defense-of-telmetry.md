# In Defense of Telemetry

Before setting up my new computer, I wanted to clarify my privacy concerns and learn more about how Microsoft collects & uses data. 

* I lack the skills & knowledge to manually ensure my system is updated, secure, and working properly. Ultimately, I have to place some trust with an authority. Microsoft is that authority. 
* I believe in providing vendors with certain types of data. The OS is a complex beast - it's buggy and it's constantly being exploited. Data collected & aggregated from the wild is the fastest way for vendors to detect & patch issues. 

At this point I can hear people yelling, "You trust Microsoft? Are you crazy?". The obvious answer is yes, I have a certain trust in Microsoft. And so do you and the millions of other people & businesses that use Microsoft. If we didn't, I wouldn't be writing this and you wouldn't be reading it. 

Extending trust always includes the risk of it being violated - intentionally or untentionally. But I worked in online education for 9 years and saw first-hand how privacy & security laws evolved in the public school space. And I can extrapolate that experience to health, banking, government, the military, e-commerce, and plenty of other sectors. 

These industries are on a never-ending quest to comply with government laws & regulations, often internationally. To maintain their dominance, Microsoft must facilitate this quest by being increasingly clear about their telemetry and by providing granular control over it. 

Relatedly, part of Microsoft's survival rests on easing adoption in an ever-shifting & complex space where there is a huge shortage of IT professionals. As a technical writer, this is especially evident in the documentation which is way more available, accessible, and consumable than even 10 years ago. This has clear benefits for non-professionals like myself who want more control and are willing to learn. 

It's also evident in the Windows 11 Pro Settings UI which provides an impressive amount of granular control and correlates closely with what can be accomplished using Group Policies. I believe this availability trickled down from Enterprise because of industry preassures - it didn't float up from Home because of preassure from personal users. 

The safest posture is to assume that EVERY vendor will collect as much data as it can. Does Microsoft want your browsing data? Of course. Do they make it easy for Home users and less technical people to fully opt-out? Actually, they're getting better. And for Pro & Enterprise users, Group Policies are pretty darn easy to learn about & implement. 

**In short, I recognize that the best way for me to maintain a secure & reliable machine is to share some data with Microsoft. And the best way to maintain my privacy is with Group Policies.**

* I want to know when updates are available, but decide when to install them.
* I want to be able to install updates automatically & securely via Microsoft.
* I want Windows Defender running with the latest threat definitions. 
* I want Microsoft to know about certain issues with my OEM hardware and OS.
* I am willing to provide very basic data. I do not want to share data about my files, accounts, search, browsing, etc. I don't want to share any log or data that could contain personal information or credentials.
